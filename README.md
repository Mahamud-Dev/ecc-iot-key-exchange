# ECC IoT Key Exchange on Raspberry Pi

A lightweight Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key exchange system simulating secure communication between two IoT devices using Python and the `cryptography` library.

## 🔐 What This Project Does

- Simulates **Device A** and **Device B**
- Generates ECC key pairs
- Exchanges public keys
- Derives the same shared secret on both sides via ECDH

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

Install using:
```bash
pip install cryptography
